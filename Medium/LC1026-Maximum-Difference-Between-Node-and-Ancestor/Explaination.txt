IDEA:
=> Our objective is to determine the maximum difference between a node and its ancestor in the tree.
=> A straightforward approach involves tracking the maximum and minimum node values along each path. 
   Upon reaching a leaf node, we compute and return its difference. For intermediate nodes, we determine 
   the maximum difference between its left and right subtrees.
=> Using this method, the problem can be solved with a time and space complexity of O(N).

TIME COMPLEXITY   : O(N)
SPACE COMPLEXITY  : O(N)
