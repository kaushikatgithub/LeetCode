IDEA:
=> Given two trees, our objective is to determine whether their leaf nodes appear in the same sequence with identical 
   values.
=> A possible approach involves traversing both trees and constructing an array to store the leaf nodes of each tree.
=> Upon completion, we compare the sizes of these leaf arrays and verify if they contain identical values in the same 
   sequence. If they differ in size or content, we return false.
